# Overview
This repository contains programs, and projects, that I have written which I feel represent examples of the best work I have done.

# Directory Structure
benchmark-binarysearch/
- This project, which is the pipeline for benchmarking a C binary for performing binary search, is really a component of a larger project.
- The larger project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/russellmatt66/GPU-samples/tree/main/BinarySearch), is a project to benchmark 
a CUDA binary for performing binary search, and determine the optimal execution configuration. I added the CPU side in order to compare the performance. 

readCodeBase/
- Recursive program to scan through a codebase, and produce a report detailing the line count of individual files for a specific programming language.
